## Code Institute - Portfolio Project 2 - JavaScript Essentials

## Testing

* After setting up the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files I checked they were linked by adding a body colour placeholder to the css file and a console.log message to the javascript file. Then opening the preview browser, typing: python3 -m http.server into the terminal. In the preview browser I could see the page was the correct colour and by inspecting the page using DevTools I could see that the message had appeared in the console.
